Welcome to my chang_page!
=========================

The **eELib** (**e**\lenia **E**\nergy **L**\ibrary) is the software tool for simulations concerning
**future power systems for prosumers**. The library with its functionalities and models can be used
for various simulative investigations regarding research or current challenges in the field of a
distributed electrical power system.

The goal of the eELib is creating a model library that is suitable for solving energy-related questions
around prosumers (consumers that are now also producing energy). This includes, among
other things, the …

- … creation and consideration of different **energy supply scenarios** (on building, district and grid
  level, among others with different penetration levels of distributed facilities like PV).
- … comparison of different **operating strategies for energy management systems**, including e.g.
  variable tariffs, multi-use concepts, operator models or schedule-based flexibility.
- … investigation of the **impacts and interactions** of prosumer households (e.g., sector coupling and
  electrification) **with the power grid** to identify violations of grid limits.
- … calculating the **economic values of different use cases and strategies** for components and systems.
- … investigation of innovative marketing strategies of market players in the spot and balancing **power
  markets**.
